Minimodem4j - general-purpose Java implementation of audio FSK modem

Minimodem4j is a command-line tool designed to interpret or generate audio modem signals at user-defined baud rates, utilizing different framing protocols. It functions as a flexible software FSK modem, supporting a variety of standard FSK protocols.

With Minimodem4j, users can interactively transmit and receive audio modem signals in real-time through the system's audio interface, or process batches of audio files. 

This tool enables data transfer between proximate computers via audio connections (or even sound waves), as well as facilitates communication between distant computers through radio, telephone, or other audio communication channels.

This implementation is inspired by C minimodem software (https://github.com/kamalmostafa/minimodem).
