# minimodem4j

**minimodem4j** is a general-purpose Java implementation of an audio Frequency-Shift Keying (FSK) modem.
It enables encoding and decoding of data over audio signals, allowing communication over sound devices or audio files.

Inspired by the [minimodem C project](https://github.com/kamalmostafa/minimodem), `minimodem4j` brings similar functionality to the Java ecosystem with no native dependencies.
